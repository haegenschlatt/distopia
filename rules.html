<h2>distopia - global rules</h2>
<p>These rules apply to all boards.</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not post or link to content that is illegal.</li>
<li>Do not post anyone's private/personal information.</li>
<li>If your link goes to a page containing obscene or adult content, include some sort of warning (simply writing "NSFW" should be fine). "Shock" images and other disgusting or grotesque material is forbidden.</li>
<li>Participating in or creating threads centered on "raiding" or causing harm/significant inconvenience to any person, party or website is prohibited.</li>
<li>Do not post racist, homophobic, lewd, or otherwise insensitive or highly offensive content.</li>
<li>Do not post spam. Automated posting/fetching (e.g. from a bot, script, or scraper) is forbidden. (If you would like an API, post your desires in the <a href="http://dis.kywu.org/board/meta">[meta]</a> board.)</li>
<li>Impersonating an Admin or mod is forbidden.</li>
<li>Avoid posting inane comments such as "lol" or "gtfo". If you agree with a statement, do not reply with only "This". Contribute your reasoning as well.</li>
<li>We reserve the right to ban anyone or remove any post at any time for any reason.</li>
<li>We may move your thread to a board where it better fits the topic.</li>
<li>Attempting to circumvent the ban, mute, or administration systems, or otherwise "hacking" the board is strictly forbidden.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2>[~] - random</h2>
<ol>
<li>Anything goes. Threads will never be moved off this board for being off-topic.</li>
<li>The global rules still apply, and are more strictly enforced on this board.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2>[meta] - meta-discussion</h2>
<ol>
<li>This board is intended for discussion regarding the site. The admins will read over this board frequently.</li>
<li>If you have complaints, bug reports, suggestions, recommendations, or questions, they should go here.</li>
<li>Please write your message or complaint in a reasonable and comprehensible manner. We will ignore indiscernable posts.</li>
<li>Admins will always post under the red "Admin" name. Anyone else claiming to be an administrator is an imposter.</li>
</ol>
